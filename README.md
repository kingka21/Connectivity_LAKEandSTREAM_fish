# Surface water connectivity affects lake and stream fish species richness and composition 

This repository has the data and code that supports the manuscript: **King, K., Bremigan, M.T., Infante, D., and Cheruvelil, K.S. 2020. Surface water connectivity affects lake and stream fish species richness and composition. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences.**  
*Note that Wisconsin has data sharing restrictions for data, therefore, these data were not published and if the code is run the results may differ from the manuscript due to WI data being excluded. However, this code reflects the code used for analysis of the manuscript. *

The manuscript takes an integrated approach that includes both lake and stream fish communities and studies how surface water connectivity affects fish species richness and composition. 


**The 'Code' folder includes the following:** \
**03_Diversity_analysis** that includes the methods for ANOVA, ANCOVA, dissimilarity, and PERMANOVA \
**04_ordination** that includes methods for the Correspondence Analysis

**The 'Datasets' folder includes the following:** \
**lakes_withoutWI.csv** which is the lake fish data. See the Metadata.doc file which describes the variables. Column names are the same as the streams data. \
**streams_withoutWI.csv** which is the stream fish data. See the Metadata.doc file which describes the variables. Column names are the same as the lakes data. 

**The 'Figures' folder includes the figures made in R for the manuscript**
